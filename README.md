# schoolNotes
Here is a repo for my school notes, if anyone needs them...


# Reading the notes
All folders for the subjects contain a `<subject>.pdf`, which is the pdf-file to be read, compiled from a `<subject>.tex` file, using the NeoVim plugin VimTeX. For example, the structure may look as such:<br/>
<pre>
├── 11 MAT
│   ├── 111 Trigonometry
│   │   ├── trigonometry.pdf
│   │   └── trigonometry.tex
├── 12 FYS
│   ├── 121 Motion
│   │   ├── Motion.pdf
│   │   └── Motion.tex
└── README.md
</pre>
Here, you would read about trigonometry in `trigonometry.pdf`, but edit using neovim & VimTeX in `trigonometry.tex`. There are lots of other files with suffixes such as `.aux`, you can safely ignore these, they are used in the VimTeX compilation process. </br>
</br>
You may download the notes to read them, but PDFs can also be read natively in GitHub just fine!


# What are those numbers?
Well, I have my files saved in a folder named `1 School Notes`, hence the numbers create a natural tree structure, and I can control the order which I want my folders in, by choosing what leading digits a folder has.
